Hello, everyone! 

I am currently learning how to be a UX/UI designer, so my goal is to be proficient in the following areas:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Javascript
  - ReactJS
  - Figma
  - Agile Development

Eventually, I would like to transition to front-end development, then possibly to full stack after.
